        <p>So which water is better, bottled or filtered?  There are so many arguments as to which water is best that it can be extremely difficult to make an informed decision.</p>
        <p>There are not as many differences between bottled water and filtered water as you might think.  Water is a fresh and natural resource, regardless of how it reaches your home or office.  For most people the main issue with unfiltered tap water is that it is chlorinated to prevent bacteria breeding in it.  The unfortunate side effect of this is a deterioration in taste.  This is why so many homes and businesses are now turning to some kind of filter tap, or water filter for their hot water boilers, mains-connected coolers and bottled water coolers.</p>
        <p>RO Systems provide one of the best and healthiest solutions to the issue of poor quality tap water.  RO Systems remove more contaminants in water than any other purification method, and they are uniquely designed to work with tap water.  The water they produce removes phthalatecontamination, and RO Systems also remove cryptosporidium from drinking water, which is known to cause gastro-intestinal illness.  The pure water product of a RO Systems costs little more than untreated tap water.  What’s more RO Systems use no more energy than is already required to drive water through your plumbing system.</p>
        <p>Drinking filtered water may be a much more economical practice than drinking bottled water, but some people prefer the convenience of having bottles of water delivered direct to their door.  In addition, using a bottled water dispenser can be useful where installing a mains-connected cooler or boiler is not feasible – all that’s needed is a standard plug socket!</p>
        <p>One conclusion is that without doubt, water tastes better when filtered using an Aquapot RO System whether you’re using a hot water boiler or water dispenser, or you decide to choose a bottle water cooler for your home or office.</p>
