        <h3> IONOI Water softeners</h3>
        <p>We call water "hard" if it contains a lot of calcium, magnesium or other minerals. Groundwater acquires these metals by dissolving them from surrounding soil and rock. Industry measures water hardness in terms of grains per gallon (GPG) or milligrams per liter (mg/L). A grain is defined as 64.8 milligrams of calcium carbonate. If your water tests at 18 mg/L or less, then you have soft water. Water around 30 - 60 mg/L occupies a gray zone between soft and slightly hard water and 60 - 120 mg/L is moderately hard. Hard water is around 120 - 180 mg/L, and very hard water is above that </p>
    <p><b>How do all those number affect you?</b></p>
    <p><strong>Hard water causes two problems:</strong></p>
    <ol>
    <li> Dissolved calcium and magnesium precipitate out of hard water as scale, which builds up on the insides of pipes, water heaters, tea kettles, kettles, coffee makers and industrial machinery. Scale reduces flow through pipes and is a poor conductor of heat. Eventually, pipes can become completely clogged.</li>
    <li> Hard water reduces soap's ability to lather, whether in the shower, sink, dishwasher or washing machine, and reacts with soap to form a sticky scum. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>IONOI water softener removes the problem (minerals in the water), a descaler addresses the damage caused by the problem (scale buildup). You will sometimes see ads for "salt-free water softeners," which are actually descalers, or for magnetic water softeners, which remain unproven and don't change the chemical composition of water, so buyer beware. </p>
    <p>With all this in mind, it's clear why water softeners are so popular: They remain the least costly and most effective way to rid your water of troublesome minerals.</p>
    <p>Acquaa offers a wide range of softening plants with versatility in flow, flexibility in resin quantities and ease in operation.IONOI is one of the leading manufacturers of water softeners in India.</p>
